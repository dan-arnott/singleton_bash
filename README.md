Purpose
-------------

The purpose of this script is to demonstrate a bash scripts template that I've been experimenting with over the last year. (It is to be considered alpha and subject to change.) It is modeled after the functional facade pattern utilizing singletons.  I believe the resulting pattern allows for better scoping and separation of concerns, especially when utilized in large projects with many scripts acting as interdependent modules.
